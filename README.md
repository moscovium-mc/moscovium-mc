Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a full stack developer and security researcher with 13 years of hands-on experience creating dynamic, scalable applications and building OSINT and cybersecurity tools. I specialize in developing responsive user interfaces, server-side solutions, and security research utilities that work seamlessly across platforms.

I bring together expertise in modern web development with React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, alongside deep security knowledge in Python and Bash for penetration testing tools, OSINT reconnaissance, and automated security frameworks. I write clean, maintainable code and deliver comprehensive solutions—whether building RESTful APIs, implementing authentication systems, or developing reconnaissance tools.

## Current Focus

I'm currently dedicated to advancing my work in offensive security tool development and full-stack web applications. My primary focus includes enhancing multi-source breach intelligence platforms, developing advanced reconnaissance utilities with Cloudflare bypass capabilities, and creating high-performance security testing tools. I continue to build responsive web applications that demonstrate modern development practices while maintaining several open-source security projects.

## Learning Journey

As part of my commitment to continuous growth in both development and security, I'm continually expanding my knowledge in the following areas:

- Advanced offensive security techniques and red team operations
- Exploit development and vulnerability research methodologies
- Cloud security and infrastructure penetration testing
- Modern web development patterns and performance optimization
- Automation and tooling for security research and OSINT collection

I'm excited about applying my extensive programming experience to both creating user-friendly applications and developing cutting-edge security solutions.

## Experience
